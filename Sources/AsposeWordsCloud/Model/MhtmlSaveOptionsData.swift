The default value is false. By default, resources in MHTML documents are referenced by file name (for example, "image.png"), which are matched against "Content-Location" headers of MIME parts. This option enables an alternative method, where references to resource files are written as CID (Content-ID) URLs (for example, "cid:image.png") and are matched against "Content-ID" headers. In theory, there should be no difference between the two referencing methods and either of them should work fine in any browser or mail agent.
